# Task-Organizer
--created during the second semester

This program helps you schedule a number of activities and is console-based. It works based on the Trajan's Algorithm and DFS topological sorting.

You need to introduce the name of the activity, the duration of it and what activities need to be finished before this new one starts.
The progam will compute the earliest/latest end and start times, starting from hour 0.

You also have a base set of activities for demonstration purposes.
